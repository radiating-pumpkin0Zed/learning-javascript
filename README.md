# Learning JavaScript 🚀

Welcome to my little corner of chaos where I attempt to learn JavaScript without losing my sanity.  
Expect lots of `console.log()` spam, random experiments, and probably some code that makes no sense (yet).  

## Why tho?
Because apparently you can’t escape JavaScript if you touch the web.  
Might as well embrace the chaos and learn it properly.

## What’s in here?
- Random practice files 📝  
- Small projects that may or may not work ⚡  
- Notes to future me (hi, stop forgetting semicolons)  

## Goals 🎯
- Understand the basics without crying  
- Build something that actually runs  
- Maybe become friends with async/await one day
